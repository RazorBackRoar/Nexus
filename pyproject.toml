# Nexus - MACOS APPLICATION
# ============================================================================
# This pyproject.toml follows RazorBackRoar workspace standards
# Last Updated: 2026-01-28
# Python Version: 3.13.x (STRICT LOCK - never upgrade to 3.14+)
# ============================================================================
# USAGE: Copy this template and replace:
# - Nexus with "4Charm", "Nexus", or "Papyrus"
# - nexus with "four_charm", "nexus", or "papyrus"
# - Update dependencies section with app-specific requirements
# ============================================================================

[project]
name = "nexus"
version = "5.14.9"
description = "Nexus - macOS application"
requires-python = ">=3.13,<3.14"
# WHY: Python 3.13.x is locked per IDE_CONTEXT.md requirements

dependencies = [
    "PySide6>=6.6.0",
    "razorcore",  # Shared foundation library
    # Add app-specific dependencies here
]

# ============================================================================
# RUFF CONFIGURATION - STANDARDIZED ACROSS ALL RAZORBACKROAR PROJECTS
# ============================================================================
# This exact configuration should be mirrored in:
# - /Users/home/Workspace/Apps/.razorcore/pyproject.toml
# - /Users/home/Workspace/Apps/4Charm/pyproject.toml
# - /Users/home/Workspace/Apps/Nexus/pyproject.toml
# - /Users/home/Workspace/Apps/Papyrus/pyproject.toml
#
# CRITICAL: Any changes to Ruff config must be synchronized across all 4 files
# WHY: Ensures consistent code style across entire RazorBackRoar workspace
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# RULE SELECTION
# ============================================================================
# Starting with essential rules, expand gradually as team agrees
# WHY: Too many rules at once = developer frustration and ignored warnings

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    # ESSENTIAL RULES - Always enforce these
    "E",      # pycodestyle errors (PEP 8 violations)
    "F",      # pyflakes (undefined names, unused imports, etc.)
    "I",      # isort (import sorting)

    # CODE QUALITY - Catch common bugs
    "B",      # flake8-bugbear (likely bugs and design problems)
    "C4",     # flake8-comprehensions (better list/dict/set comprehensions)
    "UP",     # pyupgrade (modernize Python code for your version)

    # STYLE - Keep code readable
    "N",      # pep8-naming (function/variable naming conventions)
    "W",      # pycodestyle warnings

    # DOCUMENTATION - Enforce good practices
    "D",      # pydocstyle (docstring conventions)
]

# Rules to ignore (with explanations)
ignore = [
    "D100",   # Missing docstring in public module
    "D101",   # Missing docstring in public class
    "D102",   # Missing docstring in public method
    "D103",   # Missing docstring in public function
    "D104",   # Missing docstring in public package
    "D107",   # Missing docstring in __init__
    # WHY: Docstrings are good but enforcing them everywhere is overwhelming
    # TODO: Remove these ignores gradually as documentation improves

    "E501",   # Line too long
    # WHY: Ruff's formatter handles this automatically
]

# ============================================================================
# SPECIFIC RULE CONFIGURATIONS
# ============================================================================

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
# Test files don't need docstrings and can use assert statements
"tests/**/*.py" = ["D", "S101"]

# __init__.py files often just import for convenience
"__init__.py" = ["F401"]

[tool.ruff.lint.pydocstyle]
# Use Google-style docstrings (most popular in Python community)
convention = "google"
# WHY: Google style is clean and widely recognized

[tool.ruff.lint.isort]
# Organize imports consistently
known-first-party = ["nexus", "razorcore"]
# WHY: Tells isort which imports are your code vs third-party libraries
# IMPORTANT: Replace nexus with your actual module name

# Separate import groups with a blank line
lines-after-imports = 2

[tool.ruff.format]
# Use double quotes for strings (Python community standard)
quote-style = "double"

# Use spaces for indentation (never tabs)
indent-style = "space"

# Keep line endings Unix-style (LF not CRLF)
line-ending = "lf"
# WHY: macOS uses Unix-style line endings

# ============================================================================
# MIGRATION NOTES
# ============================================================================
# HISTORY: Migrated from Pylint to Ruff (2025)
# REASON: Ruff is 10-100x faster, combines multiple tools (Pylint, Black,
#         isort, Flake8, pyupgrade), and has better IDE integration
#
# REPLACED TOOLS:
# - Pylint → Ruff (linting)
# - Black → Ruff (formatting)
# - isort → Ruff (import sorting)
# - Flake8 → Ruff (style checking)
# - pyupgrade → Ruff (syntax modernization)
# ============================================================================
